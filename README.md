# Quit Your Fucking Shitty Job, and move into the Ethereum blockchain space.

Status: Just starting out, contract yet to be designed. A multisig wallet has been deployed to [0xb5fbae0361855617c58ef95a186889f0122e6642](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5fbae0361855617c58ef95a186889f0122e6642),
and this will shortly be made into a community managed multisig.

A DAO to help people transitioning from their fucking shitty job into the Ethereum blockchain space.

Some initial ideas:

* Provide a loan (repayment not enforced, ever) for people who provide a Proof of Quitting and are serious about moving
  into the Ethereum blockchain space
* Provide funding for the education of people moving into the Ethereum blockchain space, focusing in Sydney and Australia initially
* Provide funding to build public utilities for the Ethereum ecosystem
* Funding to initially be contributed by BokkyPooBah's clients (portion of fees)
* Charitable contributions welcome
* Ethereum crowdsale projects are encouraged to contribute, as they will be part beneficiaries of the increasing resources
  available through this program
* A few trusted community members to help govern the DAO, with the aim for equal gender representation
* Voting, governance and lots of things to be worked out

Let's make it happen!
